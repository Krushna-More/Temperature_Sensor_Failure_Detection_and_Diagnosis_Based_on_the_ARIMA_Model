# Temperature_Sensor_Failure_Detection_and_Diagnosis_Based_on_the_ARIMA_Model
The DPEDETS method uses ARIMA to monitor the health of temperature sensors and detect errors, ensuring reliable measurement of sensing data during failure. It has been tested and shown to be effective in detecting variations and distinguishing confusion in temperature data from different sensor types.
